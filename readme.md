# Lab 1:

Write Structure Employee (ID, Name, and Salary).
Make a pointer to the structure and allocate it with a number read by the user
Fill the allocated array and then print it.
Make a function with default argument values and use it.
Try the scope operator

--------------------------------------------------------
# Lab 2:

Convert your Employee structure to a class and all its data will be private(the name will be char *).
Write setter and getter for each property in your class (it must be public).
Write a swap function that takes a reference for tow variables and swaps values.
Try function overloading and inline function.

--------------------------------------------------------
# Lab 3:

Write three constructors for your Employee class as you like.
Write the destructor of your Employee class.
Write the copy constructor of your Employee.
Write 2 functions with the following prototype:
Employee FillEmp (int id, int Sal, char * name) and void PrintEmp (Employee emp)
Trace your program using f7 key.

--------------------------------------------------------
# Lab 4

Overload the +, =, ==, int, char *operators to do the following:
Emp +Emp 
1000 +Emp
Emp+1000
”Ahmed”+Emp
Emp+”Ahmed”
(int)Emp returns Employee id
(char *)Emp returns Employee name

--------------------------------------------------------
# Lab 5

Add a class variables for your Employee
CompanyName with setter and gettter.
EmployeeConut with getter only (you know when to increment and decrement that count).
Create an array for Employee using different constructors for the array elements.
Write a class  point.
Write a class Rectangle that HAS 2 points.
Write a member function in the Rectangle that gets its area.

--------------------------------------------------------
# Lab 6

Write a class circle that knows 2 points and has radius as a member data with its constructors as you like.
Write setters for circle’s points.
Write a member function of class circle to get its radius (use Pythagorean Theorem).
Try to deal with your circle class in the main.
Write a person class that has id and name with setters and getters.
Write Employee class that inherits person an
